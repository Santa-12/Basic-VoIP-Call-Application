To run the VoIP project on two different devices, each device must enter the IP address of the other. The process starts with Device A sending a call request to Device B. Once the request is received on Device B, the user has the option to accept or decline the call. If accepted, the call will be established between the two devices. During the call, the user can mute the microphone, record the conversation, and view the call history, which includes the IP addresses of both devices, the call duration, and other relevant details. The system ensures that the communication is seamless, and both devices can interact in real-time, with all actions being logged and available for review.
